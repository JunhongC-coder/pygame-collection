Player:
    speed
    length
    colour
    image
    rect

a new way to draw an object to a specific position:
1. define a rectangular surface with specific width and height
set.image = pygame.Surface((width, height))

2. locate the rectangular surface
self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center = (x, y))

3. to draw the rectangular surface
def draw(self):
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, colour, rect)

Sprite represents a game object.
Game objects are usually inherited from Sprite class
1. class ClassName(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
2. add super().__init__() to the __init__() function
3. must have two attributes: image, rect


Collision Detection
1. needs to define a group and add food objects to that group
- foodGroup = pygame.sprite.Group()
- foodGroup.add(food)

2. needs to detect the collision between the plyer and that group
-pygame.sprite.spritecollide(plyer, foodGroup, True)
